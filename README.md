# CacheViz üß†

CacheViz is an interactive teaching tool for breaking down cache memory mapping functions. Built to turn tough computer architecture slides into animations classmates can actually follow. The goal is simple: demystify how Direct Mapped, N-Way Set-Associative, and Fully Associative caches juggle hits, misses, and replacements through approachable visuals.

[**Live Demo on GitHub Pages**](https://roypriyanshu02.github.io/cacheviz/)

## ‚ú® Features

- Visualize 3 Core Cache Mapping Functions: **Direct Mapped, N-Way Set-Associative,** and **Fully Associative.**
- Interactive, step-by-step animations for cache **hits, misses, and replacements.**
