# Implementation Summary: Cache Mapping Modes Enhancement

## Overview
Successfully enhanced the RISC Cache-Flow application to support three cache mapping modes with comprehensive visualizations and animations.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Mode Selector UI ✓
**Location**: Left panel, below Statistics section
- Three radio button options:
  - Direct Mapped
  - N-Way Set-Associative (2-Way)
  - Fully Associative (default)
- Changing mode automatically resets the simulation
- Prevents mode changes during animations

### 2. Address Breakdown Visualization ✓
**Location**: Below command input in left panel
- Dynamically shows/hides based on mode (hidden for Fully Associative)
- **Direct Mapped Mode**: Displays [TAG | INDEX | OFFSET]
- **Set-Associative Mode**: Displays [TAG | SET | OFFSET]
- Color-coded components:
  - TAG: Purple
  - INDEX/SET: Orange
  - OFFSET: Green
- Highlights active component during animations

### 3. Direct Mapped Mode ✓
**Logic**:
- Each memory address maps to exactly one cache line
- Index calculated as: `(address / BLOCK_SIZE) % CACHE_SIZE`
- Tag calculated as: `(address / BLOCK_SIZE) / CACHE_SIZE`
- No replacement policy needed (deterministic mapping)

**Animations**:
1. CPU processing
2. Request sent on address bus
3. INDEX bits highlighted in address breakdown
4. Single target cache line highlighted with orange border
5. Tag comparison at that specific line
6. Hit/Miss animation
7. Data return on data bus

### 4. N-Way Set-Associative Mode ✓
**Logic**:
- Cache divided into sets (4 sets of 2 lines each for 8-line cache)
- Set number calculated as: `(address / BLOCK_SIZE) % NUM_SETS`
- Tag calculated as: `(address / BLOCK_SIZE) / NUM_SETS`
- Round-robin replacement within each set
- Independent replacement counters per set

**Visualizations**:
- Alternating background shades for sets
- Dashed divider lines between sets
- SET bits highlighted in address breakdown

**Animations**:
1. CPU processing
2. Request sent on address bus
3. SET bits highlighted in address breakdown
4. All lines in target set highlighted
5. Associative search within the set
6. Hit/Miss animation
7. Data return on data bus

### 5. Cache Set Grouping ✓
**Visual Design**:
- Sets displayed with alternating background colors (light/lighter green)
- Subtle dashed divider lines between sets
- Dynamic rendering based on ASSOCIATIVITY constant
- Seamlessly integrates with existing cache line visualization

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Enhancements
- Added `ASSOCIATIVITY` constant (configurable, default: 2)
- Enhanced state object with:
  - `mode`: tracks current mapping mode
  - `setReplacementCounters`: per-set replacement tracking
- New helper functions:
  - `getIndex()`: calculates cache line index
  - `getSet()`: calculates set number
  - `getOffset()`: extracts offset bits
  - `getTag()`: mode-aware tag extraction
  - `updateAddressBreakdown()`: updates address display
  - `highlightAddressBreakdown()`: highlights active component
  - `highlightTargetLines()`: shows target cache locations
  - `renderSetGrouping()`: draws set backgrounds
  - `handleModeChange()`: manages mode transitions
- Updated functions to be mode-aware:
  - `searchCache()`: searches appropriate location(s)
  - `findVictimLine()`: selects replacement victim correctly
  - `animateCacheHit()`: includes index/set highlighting
  - `animateCacheMiss()`: includes index/set highlighting

### CSS Additions
- Mode selector styles with hover and selected states
- Address breakdown component with colored borders
- Set grouping backgrounds and dividers
- Target line highlighting animations
- Set highlight effects
- Responsive animations

### HTML Structure
- Mode selector section with radio inputs
- Address breakdown component with bit groups
- Maintained existing structure and layout

## Design Constraints Met ✓
- Existing "Fully Associative" functionality preserved
- Original design and color scheme maintained
- Seamless integration with existing UI
- No breaking changes to core functionality
- Consistent animation style across all modes

## Configuration
All modes use the same cache configuration:
- 8 cache lines
- 16-byte blocks
- 2-Way Set-Associative (when in that mode)
- Round-robin replacement policies

## Testing
Server running successfully at http://localhost:3000
- All three modes functional
- Mode switching works correctly
- Animations execute properly for each mode
- Address breakdown updates dynamically
- Set grouping displays correctly
- Statistics track accurately across modes

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Address breakdown visibility**: Only shown for Direct and Set-Associative modes
2. **Set grouping**: Uses alternating backgrounds instead of borders for clarity
3. **Replacement policy**: Maintains separate counters per set in Set-Associative mode
4. **Animation sequence**: Index/Set highlighting occurs before tag comparison
5. **Mode switching**: Automatically resets simulation to prevent inconsistent state

## Files Modified
- `/public/index.html`: Added mode selector and address breakdown UI
- `/public/styles.css`: Added 140+ lines of new styles
- `/public/app.js`: Enhanced with ~300 lines of new logic
- `/README.md`: Updated documentation

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
- Configurable associativity (4-Way, 8-Way)
- LRU replacement policy option
- Variable cache sizes
- Different block sizes
- Performance comparison metrics between modes
